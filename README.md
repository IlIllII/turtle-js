This script contains a small collection of functions that will provide basic turtle graphics to a webpage. To get started, include this script in an HTML page as well as a `<canvas id="my-canvas">` element. Once you have done this, you will be able to draw on your canvas with a turtle.

## Functionality

The script provides the following functions:

- line
- dot
- forward
- turnLeft
- turnRight

Additionally, there are some parameters you can use to change the behavior of your turtle, such as:

- context.strokeStyle
- context.lineWidth
- sleepDuration
